Image Source Model Library
============================

The library includes three functions: 

- imageSourceModel: calculates the the complex transmission loss from source
  to receiver in a bounded underwater environment (waveguide) using the Image
  Source Model. 

- lloydMiirror: calculates the transmission loss from a source to receiver
  in a semi-infinite underwater environment (top-bounded) using the Image
  Source Model.

- surfaceReflection: calculates the complex surface reflection factor given
  the angle of incidence and the wind speed. The results can be used as input
  for imageSourceModel.
